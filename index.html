            <h1>Closed on sunday</h1>
            <h2><em>Kanye West</em></h2>
            <p>
                Closed on Sunday, you're my Chick-fil-A <br>
                Closed on Sunday, you my Chick-fil-A <br>
                Hold the selfies, put the 'Gram away <br>
                Get your family, y'all hold hands and pray <br>
                When you got daughters, always keep 'em safe <br>
                Watch out for vipers, don't let them indoctrinate <br>
                Closed on Sunday, you my Chick-fil-A <br>
                You're my number one, with the lemonade <br>
                Raise our sons, train them in the faith <br>
                Through temptations, make sure they're wide awake <br>
                Follow Jesus, listen and obey <br>
                No more livin' for the culture, we nobody's slave <br>
                <br>
                Stand up for my home <br>
                Even if I take this walk alone <br>
                I bow down to the King upon the throne <br>
                My life is His, I'm no longer my own <br>
                I pray to God that He'll strengthen my hand <br>
                They will think twice steppin' onto my land <br>
                I draw the line, it's written in the sand <br>
                Try me and you will see that I ain't playin' <br>
                Now, back up off my family, move your hands <br>
                I got my weapons in the spirit's land <br>
                I, Jezebel don't even stand a chance <br>
                Jezebel don't even stand a chance <br>
            </p>
