                <p>
                    Closed on Sunday, you're my <em>Chick-fil-A</em> <br>
                    Closed on Sunday, you my <em>Chick-fil-A</em> <br>
                    Hold the selfies, put the 'Gram away <br>
                    Get your family, y'all hold hands and pray <br>
                    When you got daughters, always keep 'em safe <br>
                    Watch out for vipers, don't let them indoctrinate <br>
                    Closed on Sunday, you my <em>Chick-fil-A</em> <br>
                    You're my number one, with the lemonade <br>
                    Raise our sons, train them in the faith <br>
                    Through temptations, make sure they're wide awake <br>
                    Follow Jesus, listen and obey <br>
                    No more livin' for the culture, we nobody's slave <br>
                    <br>
                    Stand up for my home <br>
                    Even if I take this walk alone <br>
                    I bow down to the King upon the throne <br>
                    My life is His, I'm no longer my own <br>
                    I pray to God that He'll strengthen my hand <br>
                    They will think twice steppin' onto my land <br>
                    I draw the line, it's written in the sand <br>
                    Try me and you will see that I ain't playin' <br>
                    Now, back up off my family, move your hands <br>
                    I got my weapons in the spirit's land <br>
                    I, Jezebel don't even stand a chance <br>
                    Jezebel don't even stand a chance <br>
                </p>
